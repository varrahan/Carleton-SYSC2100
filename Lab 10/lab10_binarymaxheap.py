# Class BinaryMaxHeap implements the priority queue interface, using a max-heap
# as the underlying data structure. (The higher the value of an element, the
# higher its priority.) The remove/delete_max operations remove the
# highest-priority element.

# Class BinaryMaxHeap stores a heap as a complete binary tree. Typically,
# the tree is represesented as an array, with the nodes arranged in
# breadth-first order. (The root is stored at index 0, the root's left
# child is stored at index 1, the root's right child is stored at index 2,
# etc.)

# BinaryMaxHeap uses a Python list instead of an array, because (unlike a
# fixed-capacity array), a list keeps track of the number of objects it
# contains and it will increase its capacity as required.

# Given the index of a node, we can call these functions to determine the
# index of the node's parent, left child and right child.
