# Class BinaryHeap implements the priority queue interface, using a min-heap
# as the underlying data structure. (The lower the value of an element, the
# higher its priority.) The remove/delete_min operations remove the
# highest-priority element.

# History:
# Version 1.00 March 23, 2023 - Modified the array-based BinaryHeap to store the
#                               heap's tree in a list instead of an array.
# Version 1.01 March 24, 2023 - Updated comments.

# Class BinaryHeap stores a heap as a complete binary tree. Typically,
# the tree is represesented as an array, with the nodes arranged in
# breadth-first order. (The root is stored at index 0, the root's left
# child is stored at index 1, the root's right child is stored at index 2,
# etc.)

# BinaryHeap uses a Python list instead of an array, because (unlike a
# fixed-capacity array), a list keeps track of the number of objects it
# contains and it will increase its capacity as required.

# Given the index of a node, we can call these functions to determine the
# index of the node's parent, left child and right child.
